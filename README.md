# Getting Started with Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging game where a player attempts to guess a randomly selected number within a predefined range. Here's a basic description of how the game typically works:

### Objective:
The goal of the game is for the player to correctly guess the randomly generated number within a specified range.
### Game Setup:
The game starts with the computer generating a random number within a predefined range (e.g., between 1 and 100).
The player is informed of the range within which the number lies.
### Player Interaction:
The player makes a guess by entering a number within the specified range.
After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player indicating whether the guessed number is higher, lower, or equal to the randomly generated number.
### Feedback:
If the guessed number is equal to the randomly generated number, the game congratulates the player and ends.
If the guessed number is higher or lower than the randomly generated number, the game informs the player and allows them to continue guessing.
Optionally, the game may limit the number of attempts the player can make before the game ends.
### End of Game:
The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number.
Alternatively, the game may end if the player exceeds the maximum number of allowed attempts without guessing the correct number.
### Optional Features:
Additional features can be added to enhance the gameplay, such as keeping track of the player's score based on the number of attempts taken, providing hints, or allowing the player to select the range of numbers.

## Overall, the Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive way to challenge the player's logic and intuition while providing an enjoyable gaming experience.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
