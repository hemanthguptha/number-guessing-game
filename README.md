# Getting Started with Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging game where a player attempts to guess a randomly selected number within a predefined range. Here's a basic description of how the game typically works:

### Objective:
The goal of the game is for the player to correctly guess the randomly generated number within a specified range.
### Game Setup:
The game starts with the computer generating a random number within a predefined range (e.g., between 1 and 100).
The player is informed of the range within which the number lies.
### Player Interaction:
The player makes a guess by entering a number within the specified range.
After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player indicating whether the guessed number is higher, lower, or equal to the randomly generated number.
### Feedback:
If the guessed number is equal to the randomly generated number, the game congratulates the player and ends.
If the guessed number is higher or lower than the randomly generated number, the game informs the player and allows them to continue guessing.
Optionally, the game may limit the number of attempts the player can make before the game ends.
### End of Game:
The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number.
Alternatively, the game may end if the player exceeds the maximum number of allowed attempts without guessing the correct number.
### Optional Features:
Additional features can be added to enhance the gameplay, such as keeping track of the player's score based on the number of attempts taken, providing hints, or allowing the player to select the range of numbers.

#### Overall, the Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive way to challenge the player's logic and intuition while providing an enjoyable gaming experience.
